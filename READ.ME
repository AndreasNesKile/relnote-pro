# RelNote Pro

Automatic, clean, and consistent changelogs & release notes ‚Äî with **monorepo support (pnpm/yarn workspaces)**, **SemVer suggestions**, and **Keep a Changelog**-style output. Runs as a **GitHub Action** in your repo, so code stays on GitHub.

> **TL;DR:** Merge a PR ‚ûú a bullet is added under `## [Unreleased]`.  
> Publish a GitHub Release ‚ûú that content moves to `## [x.y.z] ‚Äì YYYY-MM-DD` and is copied to the release body.

- üß≠ **SemVer suggestion:** Major on breaking, minor for features, patch for fixes/docs/refactor ‚Ä¶
- üß© **Monorepo support:** Detects workspaces and can add `[package]` scope in bullets.
- üìù **Release sync:** On Release publish, moves Unreleased content to the new version section and sets the release body.
